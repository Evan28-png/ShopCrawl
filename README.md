# Online shopping community

## Overview
ShopCrawl is an intelligent shopping assistant that compares prices, ratings, and other factors across Amazon, Kilimall, Jumia and Alibaba, using MB and CB analysis to help users make the best purchasing decisions.

## Problem Statement
Online shoppers face challenges in comparing price, shipping costs, ratings and payment options across different e-commerce platforms often leading to higher costs or lower-quality purchases due to a lack of effective comparison tools.

## Solution Statement
ShopCrawl automates product comparison across Amazon, Kilimall, Jumia and Alibaba using MB and CB analysis to rank items by price, ratings and delivery terms allowing users to customize rankings for smarter shopping decisions.

## Project MVP/User Stories
- Query a product, index data from at least 4 e-commerce sites (Amazon, Kilimall, Jumia and Alibaba) and rank search results by price (beta).
- Allow clients to filter the data according to their preference (e.g., alter ranking criteria).
- Guest users can search and view results without logging in.
- Registered users can save and access search history.
- Both guest and registered users can navigate to the specific website (Amazon, Kilimall, Jumia or Alibaba) products by clicking on the specific product image(toggle button).
